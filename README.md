## About The Project
Here's a just minimal template to get started with Test Driven Development.

### Built With

* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
* [ts-jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-jest)


## Getting Started
First of all install dependencies

  ```sh
  npm install
  ```

## Usage

To run all tests at once:
  ```sh
  npm run test
  ```

To run test in watch mode:
  ```sh
  npm run test:watch
  ```

Watch files for changes and rerun tests related to changed files. If you want to re-run all tests when a file has changed, use instead:

  ```sh
  npm run test:watchAll
  ```
